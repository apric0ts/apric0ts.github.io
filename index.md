# About

Thanks for checking out my website! I'm Austin, a second year CS student at Northeastern University. I'm passionate about <span style="color: orange;">robotics, simulation, digital twins, AI, and computational geometry.</span>

I'm currently collaborating with:
- [COMET](https://www.njii.com/comet-project/) >> Software Intern
    - Digital twins with [NVIDIA Omniverse](https://developer.nvidia.com/omniverse) and [OpenUSD](https://openusd.org/release/intro.html)
- [Autonomy & Intelligence Laboratory at Northeastern University](https://neu-autonomy.github.io/lab_website/) >> Research Assistant
    - High speed motion planning for mobile robots leveraging [MPPI algorithm](https://docs.nav2.org/configuration/packages/configuring-mppic.html?highlight=mppi)
- [Smart Soles, NU Robotics Club ](https://coe.northeastern.edu/orgs/northeastern-robotics/) >> Software Developer
    - 3D modeling and printing with implicit geometry, modeling done in [nTop](https://www.ntop.com/)

I was previously involved with:
- [Oasis at NU](https://oasisneu.com/) >> Software Developer >> [{% include svg/github.svg %}](https://github.com/Oasis-NEU/f23-group18)
    - Full-stack web application using React and Flask.
- [NJIT](https://www.njit.edu/) >> Software Intern >> [{% include svg/github.svg %}](https://github.com/cadop/fusion360descriptor)
    - [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/) to URDF exporter for robot link configurations
    - Project featured in [NVIDIA GTC Spring 23](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring23-se52203/?start=3780)


I enjoy building keyboards, video essays, winter sports, and coming up with hypotheses to answer the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox)!
